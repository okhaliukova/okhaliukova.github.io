About Me
------
I am a Data Scientist and Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</a> at the Colorado School of Mines. I earned hmy BS in Management from the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv in 2011, followed by an MS in Agricultural and Resource Economics from <a href="[https://ut.edu/](https://arec.tennessee.edu/)" target="_blank">The University of Tennessee</a>, Knoxville, in 2013. In December 2023, she completed an MS in Data Science from Mines. Currently, she is pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Statistics, focusing on methane emissions inventory and monitoring using aerial and ground-based data. She actively engages in academic colloquiums and Kernel Klubs organized by AMS department, volunteered at the 2023 International Indian Statistical Association Conference, and has presented her research at various events and conferences. Upon graduation, Olga plans to pursue a career as a Data Scientist in the energy security sector.



I specialize in Bayesian modeling, MCMC simulation, and machine learning. I develop predictive and risk modeling frameworks that quantify uncertainty and improve decision-making in financial and environmental systems. Proficient in R and Python, experienced in leading interdisciplinary teams to build quantitative solutions for complex real-world problems.
