About Me
------
I am a Data Scientist and Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</a> at the Colorado School of Mines, where I also earned an M.S. in Data Science (2023). I hold an M.S. in Agricultural and Resource Economics from <a href="https://www.utk.edu/" target="_blank">the University of Tennessee</a>, Knoxville (2013), and a B.S. in Management from <a href="https://nubip.edu.ua/en" target="_blank">the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine</a>, Kyiv (2011).

My research focuses on non-linear estimation of heavy-tailed distributions, Bayesian modeling, MCMC simulation, and machine learning applications in environmental and financial systems. As a member of the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/hammerling-research-group/" target="_blank">Hammerling Research Group</a>, which develops advanced computational and statistical modeling to address complex challenges in energy, climate, engineering, and society, I have designed Monte Carlo–based models to estimate site-level methane emissions from aerial measurements at <a href="https://www.cheniere.com/" target="_blank">Cheniere Energy, Inc.</a> liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, integrating instantaneous and inventory-based frameworks. I am advised by <a href="https://dnychka.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Doug Nychka</a> and <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/project/hammerling-dorit/" target="_blank">Dr. Dorit Hammerling</a>. My previous experience includes work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank">NIST</a>), Assured Bio Labs (<a href="https://assuredbio.com/" target="_blank">ABL</a>), and the Center for Renewable Carbon (<a href="https://crc.tennessee.edu/" target="_blank">CRC</a>).

I live in the Denver area and love taking advantage of everything Colorado has to offer, whether it’s hiking with my dog, backpacking, camping, rock climbing, or snowboarding through the tree runs at Winter Park.
