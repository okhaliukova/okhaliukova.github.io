About Me
------
I am a Data Scientist and Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</a> at the Colorado School of Mines, where I also earned an M.S. in Data Science (2023). I hold an M.S. in Agricultural and Resource Economics from the <a href="https://www.utk.edu/" target="_blank">University of Tennessee</a>, Knoxville (2013), and a B.S. in Management from the <a href="https://nubip.edu.ua/en" target="_blank">National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine</a>, Kyiv (2011).

My research focuses on nonlinear modeling approaches, including Bayesian and machine learning methods, for heavy-tailed data in environmental systems. Advised by <a href="https://dnychka.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Doug Nychka</a> and <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/project/hammerling-dorit/" target="_blank">Dr. Dorit Hammerling</a>, I work in the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/hammerling-research-group/" target="_blank">Hammerling Research Group</a> on statistical modeling for complex problems in energy, climate, and engineering. 

I am affiliated with the <a href="https://https://payneinstitute.mines.edu/" target="_blank">Payne Institute for Public Policy</a> and the Energy Emissions Modeling and Data Lab (<a href="https://www.eemdl.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">EEMDL</a>), a collaborative research initiative developing data-driven models for greenhouse-gas emissions quantification in the oil and gas sector. Within EEMDL, I worked with <a href="https://www.cheniere.com/" target="_blank">Cheniere Energy, Inc.</a> to develop Monte Carlo–based models for estimating methane emissions from liquefied natural gas (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestair.4c00301" target="_blank">LNG</a>) facilities. My previous experience includes work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank">NIST</a>), Assured Bio Labs (<a href="https://assuredbio.com/" target="_blank">ABL</a>), and the Center for Renewable Carbon (<a href="https://crc.tennessee.edu/" target="_blank">CRC</a>).

I live in the Denver area and love taking advantage of everything Colorado has to offer, whether it’s hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, or snowboarding through the tree runs at Winter Park.
