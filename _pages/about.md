Welcome! I’m Olga Khaliukova — a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Statistics at the Colorado School of Mines.
My research focuses on Bayesian modeling, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven risk assessment
with applications in environmental and financial systems.

This site shares my research, publications, and teaching work.
