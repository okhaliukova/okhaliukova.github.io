About Me
------
I am a Data Scientist and Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</a> at the Colorado School of Mines. I earned my BS in Management from the <a href="https://nubip.edu.ua/en" target="_blank">National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine</a> in Kyiv in 2011, followed by an MS in Agricultural and Resource Economics from <a href="https://www.utk.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Tennessee</a>, Knoxville, in 2013. 

I specialize in Bayesian modeling, MCMC simulation, and machine learning. I develop predictive and risk modeling frameworks that quantify uncertainty and improve decision-making in financial and environmental systems. Proficient in R and Python, experienced in leading interdisciplinary teams to build quantitative solutions for complex real-world problems.
